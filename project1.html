                  <p>In this project, my work is design a logo for a game development company which
                    only design role playing game. This company wants people to show their real self
                    while playing their game. They want to satisfy people’s dream by creating a platform
                    for them to role play different character in their game, and to do something that
                    they can’t in real life, to show their brave side in our game. </p>

                  <h4 class="code-render-title">STEP1: Research and Brainstorme</h4>

                <p>In order to better understand to design the appropriate logo for the company,
                  I first did the researches about company and its target audience and started
                  brainstorming based on the search. I write down all the design elements and
                  keywords associated with the game topic, and pick up the most relevant words
                  of the company's intentio. Finally did a quick sketch to take down the ideas.</p>

              <div class="element-box">
                <h4 class="code-render-title">Display</h4>

              <div class="code-box">
                  <h4 class="code-render-title">STEP2: Sketches & Draw on illustrator</h4>

                <p>In this step, based on the previously selected design elements, I began to conceive
                  and sketch as many sketch version as possible and pick up the most competitive logos
                  and to draw with illustrator. In this process, I will not consider the colors
                  application temporarily, but quickly draw the shape of the logo. This help me improve
                  my efficiency and avoid wasting time working on the logo which might be eliminated finally.</p>

                  <h4 class="code-render-title">STEP3: Refined version</h4>

                <p>In this step, I choose the best one from the previously works on illustrator according to
                  the display result on screen. Unlike the last step, I will focus on the colors application,
                  I need to take into account the user's visual experience. I did different version for the
                  company to provide them different choices and refine the logo based on their feedback.</p>

                <p>A single logo prototype is not enough. I also created some scenarios to show how the logo
                  can be applied. Use Photoshop to apply logo on physical objects, and show the physical visual
                  result to the company. Considering that the company is a game company, I applied the logo to
                  some products related to the game industry, such as computer and mouse to help them promote
                  their company through some non-game products.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">PROBLEMS & CHALLENGES</h2>

          <section class="container">

              <div class="element-box">
                <h4 >Company background analysis</h4>
                <p>It is a big challenge to analyze the company's background which is a necessary
                  step before a designer start design. To understand and analyze the company's
                  background in detail can help me design the appropriate logo for the company.
                  Through the research I learned that the company wanted to stand out from the
                  competition of game companies. For expressing this idea, I tried to use some
                  meaningful stories or myths. I thought of the legend of King Arthur and used
                  "sword in the stone" as the main design element of the logo. It means the
                  beginning of a new world, victory and glory. </p>
              </div>



              <div class="element-box">
                  <h4 class="code-render-title">Illustrator design</h4>
                <p>Because of the complexity of draft logos, it is also a challenge to draw them
                  quickly in illustrator. Of course, it is not difficult for me after a lot of
                  exercises. I can not only skillfully use illustrator, but also Photoshop and
                  other design software.</p>
              </div>
          </section>





          <h2 class="section-title">REFLECTION</h2>

          <section class="container">
              <div class="element-box">

                <p>Designers not only need a good aesthetic and be familiar with software operation,
                  but also need to be able to make accurate judgments on the design direction and
                  customer goal. In the early stage of the design process, research and analysis
                  are essential, and we can not start a design work rashly. In addition, from this work,
                  I also found that a well accumulation of humanistic knowledge is very helpful for the
                  design work. I can associate more design ideas from my previous knowledge accumulation.
                  For example, the legend of King Arthur gave me a lot of design ideas for designing this
                  logo. Therefore, as a designer, I not only need to exercise my design skills, but also
                  need to read more and learn more knowledge in other fields to help me think more
                  comprehensively.</p>
