                article about harajuku style in Japan. This modern fashion article provides
                some interesting information of harajuku style fashion which is favorite among
                many young people and lead audience to understand the new trend in modernal

                  <h4 class="code-render-title">STEP1: Research</h4>

                <p>As the common process of graphic design,  I first did the researches about
                  the magazine. The research focus on the field it applaied to and its target
                  audience to help me conceive the appropriate design elements. The research
                  also include the examples about the layout of relevant magazines in order
                  to apply the magazine design style to the current popular trends.</p>

                  <h4 class="code-render-title">STEP2: brainstorm</h4>

                <p>Based on my understanding of the theme of magazine and related researches, I
                  started to do brainstorm and draw as many draft layouts as possible. This is a
                  challenging step，I need to do a well layout for a large amount of text information.
                  the layout design need to consider the text readability for the readers and how to
                  arrange the position of informations so that readers can pay attention to important
                  information quickly.</p>
                </div>

              <div class="element-box">

                  <h4 class="code-render-title">STEP3: Element design</h4>

                <p>In this design step, I create elements with illustrator accroding to the previous design sketch and
                  consider of the color plate applied to the magazine. I focus on the colors and element applicability.
                  Because this is a fashion magazine about Japanese harajuku style culture, I try to use some related
                  elements, such as Memphis style geometric figures and symbols with brighter colors to cater to the
                  visual preferences of fashion lovers.</p>

                  <h4 class="code-render-title">STEP4: Layout arrangement with InDesign</h4>
                <p>In this process, I use InDesign to arrange the overall context on the magazine. InDesign allow me
                  to work with grid and margin, which helps me arrange the magazine design more efficiently. At the
                  same time,In practice, there is often an unpredictable situation. Sometimes the text exceeds the
                  expected layout area. So I did a lot of refine in this step to put all the content into the magazine
                  page appropriately.</p>

                <p>I invited some designer peers to view the work and give their feedback. I ask some questions about
                  their reading experience —— how they are feeling? Do these visual designs and layout guide them to
                  read article content effectively? According to the feedback I refined it and finish the final version
                  of magazine finally. </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">PROBLEMS & CHALLENGES</h2>

      <section class="container">

          <div class="element-box">
            <h4 >Layout exploration</h4>
            <p>The biggest challenge of this design is to do a well layout for a large amount
              of text information. It is not only need to make the text readable for the readers,
              but also need to include all the required information within the limited magazine
              page size. In addition, the example of Banner which I learned from lecture made me
              realize that I also need to consider the arrangement of the information position to
              satisfy the user's reading experience so that the readers can find the important
              information quickly.</p>
            </div>
              <div class="element-box">
              <h4 >Exploration and self creation solutions</h4>
              <p>Before I drew the framework draft, I self created a collage method which
              help me to explored the layout before design. First, I found some fashion magazines,
              and cut some square blocks of similar size as the text area of them. Then I prepared
              a piece of white paper with the specified size as the background, and put the square
              blocks on it to explore the layout. This method is very interesting and helps me find
              some suitable layouts.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">REFLECTION</h2>

      <section class="container">
          <div class="element-box">

            <p>In the early stage of design, I learned a lot from the exploration process of design scheme.
              In a design process, there are many uncertain factors which I often can not discover until the
              middle stage of the design. Although I'm happy that I can come up with new ideas, but they have
              reduced the productivity: I need to spend a lot of time testing new methods for my design.
              Therefore, targeted research and pre testing can help me effectively narrow my design direction
              and improve my work efficiency.</p>
